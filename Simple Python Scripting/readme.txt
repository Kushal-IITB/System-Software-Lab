Q.2
Run the code as: python3 fetch_data.py <inputfile>
The output file is sorted in increasing order

Q.3
Run the code as: python3 text_to_csv.py tenth.txt
We have treated the "tenth.txt" as being sacred and created the cbseProcessed.csv in accordance with the "tenth.txt"
The cbseProcessed.csv is different from the model output published by the instructor eg: There is no column named Addl. subject in the model output but we have created this column to be consistent with input text file
As being CodeWarriors we have to be consistent with the data file given as input

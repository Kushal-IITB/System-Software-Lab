Honur Code:
I pledge on my honor, I have not used any unfair means nor provided any unauthorised assistance to any.

Specifications : 
Question1:
	Run octave in the project directory.
	From their run projectile.m. Then on the program behaves interactively
	Program takes in x0,y0,x,y,v as input and returns ranges of plausible angles for the 3 cases.
	For case 2 and case 3 the range of theta has been decreased to -82.999 to 89.999, since at normal velocities the graphs oscillates very fast in values close to -90 or +90.
	In case of high velocities, program might output absurd ranges for case 2 and 3.
	We have implemented a fast algorithm because of which accuracy has been slightly compromised. Our program first does a crude search of range in steps of 0.1.
	Then on these crude ranges, program searches in steps of 0.01.  
	
Question2:
	Run octave in the project directory.
	From their run pagerank.m. Then on the program behaves interactively.
	Program assumes that file small.txt is provided as input & program file are present in the same folder.
	If not, an appropriate error-message will be flagged.
